## Day 7
### CaesarCipher.py
The Caesar cipher algorithm. Gives users the option to either decrypt or encrypt a given message. The message is then shifted by a given number of positions in the alphabet. This program also takes into account if the user enters a shift amount over the number of letters in the alphabet by continuing to shift the given amount.

## Day 8
### SilentAuction.py
Simulates a silent auction. Prompts the user to enter a name and a bid, and then stores each name and bid inside a dictionary. The program then asks if there are any other bidders. If not, then the program terminates and determines a winner, which will be the person with the highest bid.

## Day 9
### Calculator.py
A simple calculator to perform simple arithmetic operations.

## Day 10
### Blackjack.py
A game of Blackjack between a user and a computer.

## Day 11
### GuessTheNumber.py
Generates a random number between 1 and 100 that the user must guess. Depending on the difficulty chosen by the user, they will have 10 attempts to guess if user chooses easy; otherwise, 5 if they choose hard. If the user runs out of guesses, then the correct answer is revealed.

## Day 12
### HigherLower.py
Generates two random accounts from a given data set, GameData.py, and prompts the user to guess which account has more followers. If they get it right, they can resume playing until they get it wrong.
